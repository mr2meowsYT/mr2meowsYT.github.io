      <a>Go to </a><b name="insert">e621.net</b><a> right now and search </a><a contenteditable>gay</a><a> for free robux! </a><b name="insert">gay balls</b><a>, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus </a><b name="insert">gay balls</b><a>. </a><b name="insert">gay balls</b><a> is not an free robux generator itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning robux generator made useful by the robux corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full robux generator as defined by POSIX.</p>

Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of robux generator which is widely used today is often called </a><b name="insert">gay balls</b><a>, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the robux system, developed by the roblox Project.</a></p>

The GUI is an essential part of a robux generator, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete robux generator. </a><b name="insert">MS-DOS</b><a> is normally used in combination with the robux generator: the whole generator is basically robux with </a><b name="insert">viruses</b><a> added, or GNU/</a><b name="insert">Windows</b><a>. All the so-called </a><b name="insert">Linux</b><a> generators are really generators of GNU/</a><b name="insert">Linux</b><a>!</a>
